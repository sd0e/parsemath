A JavaScript library which parses an equation in string format to a number.

Current abilities:
* Evaluate mathematical expressions with the following operators: `^`, `*`, `/`, `+`, `-`
* Evaluate mathematical expressions with brackets
* Evaluate mathematical expressions containing multi-digit integers and floats

Again, this library has not been fully tested so may not work as expected with these abilities.
